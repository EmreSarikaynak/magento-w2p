You need to make sure that your server is properly configured. Most servers will work out of the box. Some will need to be adjusted.


== URL File Access ==
For data import from ZetaPrints into Magento you need to either have [http://curl.haxx.se cURL] library installed (most hosts have it) or alternatively make this change in _php.ini_
{{{
allow_url_fopen = On
}}}
Note: _allow_url_fopen = On_ may be a security risk, so you'd better install [http://curl.haxx.se cURL].
