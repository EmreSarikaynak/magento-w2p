This document describes steps necessary to install ZetaPrints extension to Magento:
  * Configure Magento attributes
  * Copy code into Magento folders from SVN
  * Clear Magento cache
  * Run data import utility
  * Install and configure a custom theme

== Requirements ==
You are expected to have an existing Magento installation, be able to install it yourself or get help with the installation. It's quite possible there will be problems during installation of this extension or Magento itself. Most often they are limited to missing or disabled PHP/MySQL features and components, file and folder security setting other little annoying things specific to your hosting environment.


===Add Magento attributes==
Attributes are added via Magento admin UI. Log in as an administrator and navigate to _Catalog/Attributes/Manage Attributes_. Click on Add attribute button.

Leave all attribute properties at default values unless stated otherwise here.
None of these attributes should exist, unless this extension has already been installed.

Adding an attribute takes you through 2 screens. Enter values provided here. Fields _Admin_ and _Default Store View_ sit on the second screen.
