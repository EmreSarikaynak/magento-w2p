#labels Featured,Phase-Deploy
This document describes steps necessary to install ZetaPrints extension to Magento:
  * Configure Magento attributes
  * Copy code into Magento folders from SVN
  * Clear Magento cache
  * Run data import utility
  * Install and configure a custom theme

== Requirements ==
You are expected to have a functioning Magento installation before installing this extension. This guide requires a certain level of knowledge about Magento and website hosting. Ask someone qualified to help you.

== Back up ==
Your Magento set up may stop working after making changes and adding this extension. It's a good idea to make a back up of the code, your current theme and the DB first. Back it up. Takes 5 mins - saves days.

==Add Magento attributes==
Attributes are added via Magento admin UI. Log in as an administrator and navigate to _Catalog/Attributes/Manage Attributes_. Click on _Add attribute_ button.

http://www.zetaprints.ru/magento/guide/Attribute_add_search.jpg

Leave all attribute properties at default values unless stated otherwise here.
None of these attributes should exist, unless this extension has already been installed. If an attribute already exists and you are not sure how it was configured, delete it and create again as per this manual.

Adding an attribute takes you through 2 screens. 

==== Properties screen ====
Most values are entered into this screen.

Fields _Admin_ and _Default Store View_ sit on the second screen. The screen appears automatically when you click _Save_ or you can activate the screen by clicking on _Manage Labels/Options_ in the menu on the left.

== Copy source code and config file ==

The source code is located in [http://code.google.com/p/magento-w2p/source/browse/#svn/trunk/data-import SVN code repository]. Files can be downloaded one by one or using an SVN client. The SVN location offers the latest version of the code. The last stable version is packaged in [http://code.google.com/p/magento-w2p/downloads/list Downloads section].

  * *Core Magento files*: copy everything from _app/code_ folder into _app/code_ folder in Magento. 

  * *Config files*: copy everything from _app/etc_ folder into _app/etc_ folder in Magento. 

  * *Default theme*: copy everything from _app/design_ folder into _app/design_ folder in Magento. 

*WARNING:* you may want to [http://code.google.com/p/magento-w2p/wiki/ChangedFiles modify your current theme] instead of replacing it with our default theme.

== Configure default ZetaPrints theme ==
A theme cannot be modified automatically during the install. Use the theme provided with the package as the first step and then modify your default theme to work with design personalization.

Navigate to _System/Configuration_ and choose _Design_ tab.

== Clear cache ==
Magento requires its cache to be cleared after installing an extension. Go to _System/Cache management_ and clear the cache.

  # In _All Cache_ section, select _Refresh_ from the dropdown.
  # Click _Save cache settings_.
  # Click on _Refresh_ button in Catalog Rewrites row,


== Import data ==
Once the extension is installed and configured you can import the data from your ZetaPrints portal. All your catalogs and templates are imported initially and only new and updated templates on subsequent runs. Data import needs to be initiated manually.

==== Add new profile ====
You need to create a new "profile" for data import. Navigate to _System / Import/Export / Advanced Profiles / Add New Profile_ and create the following profile.
  * *Name*: ZetaPrints data import
  * *Action XML*: copy and paste the XML code below into Action XML text box
{{{
<action type="api/importzp" method="parse"></action>
}}}

==== Configure data import ====
You need to provide [http://www.zetaprints.com/help/about-web-to-print-api/ ZetaPrints API Key] and [http://www.zetaprints.com/help/category/access-url/ URL of your web-to-print portal]. Read more in ZetaPrints_Sync_Settings article.

==== Run data import ====
Complete data import configuration and navigate to _System / Import/Export / Advanced Profiles_. Select _ZetaPrints data import_ profile and click on _Run Profile_ tab on the left. Click _Run Profile in Popup_ button. It will initiate a data importing process which may take several minutes.

Re-run the data import the same way every time you add new templates or change existing ones in ZetaPrints. Data import does not delete templates from Magento even if they were removed from ZetaPrints.
