#summary Extension installation and configuration guide
#labels Featured,Phase-Deploy
This document describes steps necessary to install ZetaPrints extension to Magento:
  * Configure Magento attributes
  * Copy code into Magento folders from SVN
  * Clear Magento cache
  * Run data import utility
  * Install and configure a custom theme

== Requirements ==
You are expected to have an existing Magento installation, be able to install it yourself or get help with the installation. It's quite possible there will be problems during installation of this extension or Magento itself. Most often they are limited to missing or disabled PHP/MySQL features and components, file and folder security setting other little annoying things specific to your hosting environment.

== Back up ==
Your Magento set up may stop working after making changes and adding the extension. It's a good idea to make a back up of the code and the DB first. Back up. Takes 5 mins - saves days.

==Add Magento attributes==
Attributes are added via Magento admin UI. Log in as an administrator and navigate to _Catalog/Attributes/Manage Attributes_. Click on _Add attribute_ button.

http://www.zetaprints.ru/magento/guide/Attribute_add_search.jpg

Leave all attribute properties at default values unless stated otherwise here.
None of these attributes should exist, unless this extension has already been installed. If an attribute already exists and you are not sure how it was configured, delete it and create again as per this manual.

Adding an attribute takes you through 2 screens. 

==== Properties screen ====
Most values are entered into this screen.

==== Label / Options screen ====
Fields _Admin_ and _Default Store View_ sit on the second screen. The screen appears automatically when you click _Save_ or you can activate the screen by clicking on _Manage Labels/Options_ in the menu on the left.

== Copy source code and config file ==

The source code is located in [http://code.google.com/p/magento-w2p/source/browse/#svn/trunk/data-import SVN code repository]. Files can be downloaded one by one or using an SVN client. The SVN location offers the latest version of the code. The last stable version is packaged in [http://code.google.com/p/magento-w2p/downloads/list Downloads section].

Core Magento files: copy everything from _app/code_ folder into _app/code_ folder in Magento. 

Config files: copy everything from _app/etc_ folder into _app/etc_ folder in Magento. 

Default theme: copy everything from _app/design_ folder into _app/design_ folder in Magento. 

*WARNING:* you may want to [http://code.google.com/p/magento-w2p/wiki/ChangedFiles modify your current theme] instead of replacing it with our default theme.

	
== Clear cache ==
Magento requires cache clearing after installing an extension. Go to _Configuration/Cache mangement_ and clear the cache.

  # All Cache: select _Refresh_ from the dropdown.
  # Click _Save cache settings_.
  # Catalog Rewrites: click on _Refresh_ button.


== Run Import data ==
	+ Login as admin
	+ System -> Import/Export -> Advanced Profiles -> Add New Profile
