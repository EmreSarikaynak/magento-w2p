#summary How users are created and synced with ZetaPrints.

= Introduction =

ZetaPrints creates user profiles to manage user data (text and uploaded photos) as well as maintain current session state. It requires synchronisation of user profiles between the Magento site and ZetaPrints.

= User creation =

A user is created in ZP upon a request to update a preview or upload a photo. UserID and password are stored in Magento for future use. 

= User session =
A user session is extended to 6 months if a user was created in ZP, but not in Magento. The lifetime of the session is stored in ZP_COOKIE_LIFETIME in W2puser.php.
