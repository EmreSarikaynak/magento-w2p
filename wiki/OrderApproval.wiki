#summary Order Approval extension description

Order Approval extension allows organizing a approval process in Magento shop. Approval process is managed by approvers (a customer with enabled approver role) who are set by the administrator. Also, administrator should set approvers for each customer whose orders need approval.

Approval process sits between customer's shopping cart and the checkout process. It means that customers are able to add any number of products into their shopping cart, delete and modify them at any time without any restrictions, but they can not checkout products from the cart before they are approved.

When customers try to checkout their shopping cart, the customer's approver receives a notification about unapproved products in the customer's shopping cart. Approver can use the link from the e-mail to reach order approval UI and approve customer's products. Customers can check approval status for every product in their shopping cart and are allowed to checkout items that have already been approved.

= Approval status for cart item =
Item's option 'additional_options' was used to save and show approval status for an item.
These options are displayed in Product name column on shopping cart page.

See '_add_notice_to_approved_item' method code in [http://code.google.com/p/magento-w2p/source/browse/branches/ZetaPrints_OrderApproval/app/code/community/ZetaPrints/OrderApproval/controllers/CartController.php app/code/community/ZetaPrints/OrderApproval/controllers/CartController.php] file and code in [https://code.google.com/p/magento-w2p/source/browse/branches/ZetaPrints_OrderApproval/app/code/community/ZetaPrints/OrderApproval/controllers/OnepageController.php app/code/community/ZetaPrints/OrderApproval/controllers/OnepageController.php] file.
