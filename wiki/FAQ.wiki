= No personalization available = 
*I installed the extension, imported my templates, but there is no way to personalize the products. I see Add to cart buttons and it adds them directly to the cart if I click on it.*

You are using a custom theme. See CustomThemeNative and CustomTheme2Step pages for customization instructions. Alternatively, use the default ZP theme provided with the plugin. This can be configured on ZP configuration page in Magento.

= Templates won't import =

*Running the profile for templates importing results in "Error in receiving list of catalogs" message.*

  * Double-check the domain name and API key in the configuration.
  * Check that your ZetaPrints profile has no IP address restriction activated.


*Error in receiving detailes for template _template_guid_. Leaving the template unmodified.*

Check that the template exists in your ZetaPrints portal.

*Error in receiving list of templates for catalog _catalog_name_*

Check that the catalog exists in your ZetaPrints portal.
