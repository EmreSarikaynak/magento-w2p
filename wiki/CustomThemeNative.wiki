#summary Integration of w2p into a custom theme

= Introduction =

This document explains changes you need to make to a custom magento theme to enable our web-to-print extension.

All files listed here can be found in [http://code.google.com/p/magento-w2p/downloads/list an installation package], [http://www.magentocommerce.com/extension/1586 extension] on Magento-Connect or in the [http://code.google.com/p/magento-w2p/source/checkout svn repository].

Every file has the new code divided into several sections. Every section has its sequence number (e.g. ZP-CODE:1) and is enclosed with comments similar to this:

{{{
/****** ZP-CODE:1 Short description of code in the block ******/

some code

/****** ZP-CODE:1 End ******/
}}}

You need to modify some files behind the user interface.

==template/catalog/product/list.phtml==
This file shows products from some category in a grid or list layout.

The new code replaces _Add to cart_ button with _Personalize_ button and disables product image resizing. The code is divided into 4 section.

*Sections 1 (list layout) and 3 (grid layout)*: checking if the product has web-to-print features and if it's true then output slightly modified image tag to prevent image resizing. Also it sets maximum width for image throw 'max-width' css rule.

*Sections 2 (list layout) and 4 (grid layout)*: checking if the product has web-to-print features and it is not an already customized product (an order). In this case showing _Personalize_ button instead of _Add to cart_ one.

==template/catalog/product/view.phtml==
The purpose of the code in this file is to show form for ordering on product page. This form contains product images, product name, product description, product price, etc.

One of the purposes of new code is to check for personalization phase of the product. In this case it shows our form produced directly from template's xml. This form has additional features such as ajax image preview, colour picker, stock images chooser and support for multipage templates.

Also this code has support for ZetaPrints IFrame mode logic.

The code is divided into 4 sections.

*Section 1*: checking if the product has web-to-print features, checking for personalization phase. If both checks are true then it generates personalization form from template's xml.

*Sections 2-3*: checking if the product has web-to-print features, checking for personalization phase. If both checks are true then it shows generated personalization form.

*Section 4*: javascript code for personalization form.

==template/catalog/product/gallery.phtml==
The purpose of the code in this file is to show gallery of product additional images (in original size) in a separate window.

The purpose of new code is to use proper methods to get correct image urls for the product with web-to-print features. The code is divided into 2 sections.

*Sections 1-2*: checking if the product has web-to-print features and if it's true then getting image url with proper method.
