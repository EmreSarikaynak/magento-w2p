#summary Describe checkout process

= Checkout process =

Requirements to checkout process:
  * Administrator should always be able to track the order on ZetaPrints side.
  * The order in Magento must be saved with Problems status and some message on error situation.

The web-to-print extension tries to complete saved order (the order was created on add to cart) on ZetaPrints side after successful order checkout in M.

If saved order completion fails then the extension checks that saved order still exists on ZetaPrint side. This means that there was an error that prevented ZetaPrints from completing saved order (for example, error in sending request to ZetaPrints).
  * Saved order exists: try once more to complete saved order on ZetaPrints side. If it fails again then set status for order in M. to PROBLEMS.
  * Saved order doesn't exist: check if the final order (order after completion on ZetaPrints side) was created with the final order id (the id that was generated by the extension and was sent to ZetaPritns to track final order there).
    * If the final order exists on ZetaPrints then it means the order was process successfully on ZetaPrints side.
    * If the final order doesn't exist on ZetaPrints then it's a bug. Set status for order in M. to PROBLEMS and add message to ask contact admin with ZetaPrints.

= Up-sell products =
Then users click on link to up-sell product or its Add to cart button the web-to-print extension checks that it happened on My Cart page and activates template personalization process.
