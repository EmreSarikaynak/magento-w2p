  * maintains Magento products in sync with ZetaPrints products
  * registers new users in ZetaPrints
  * grants / denies user access to products in ZetaPrints

  * downloads order details from ZetaPrints
  * updates order status in ZetaPrints


= Products =

== Static products ==

Magento and ZetaPrints have their own product databases. 
The store can have products created directly in M without a corresponding product in ZP. Such products have no personalization capabilities.

== Dynamic products ==
This extension downloads list of catalogs, products and product details from ZP into M. 
Every product in ZP has a GUID as its unique identifier and timestamp of the last update.
This extension maintains M database in sync with ZP DB by downloading updated records.

Products in ZP have special properties and initial preview images (thumbnails and large previews). They can be downloaded into M or served directly from ZP.

== Access control ==
ZP control access at a catalog level. It is up to the shop owner to set access control to public or private. 


= Users =
== Existing ZetaPrints users ==
Any users already registered in ZP need to log into ZP themselves or be logged in via API (http://www.zetaprints.com/help/automatic-user-logon/). This may cause difficulties if the passwords get out of sync. 

== New users ==
ZP does not require full user registration to use the services. It only needs a user ID for data caching and resource allocation. This extension syncs M user data with ZP in a very limited way: UserID and Password only. No other user details are passed to ZP and all user management is carried out within Magento environment. See http://www.zetaprints.com/help/user-registration-api/ 

== User access control ==
This extension instructs ZP to grant/deny users access to certain catalogs via API (http://www.zetaprints.com/help/user-access-api/)

= Orders =
Order information is synced between ZP and M through this extension.
ZP is only concerned with the image and file generation part of the order. It produces the final product M sells to the user. 

== Shop owner order management ==
Shop owners have printer accounts with ZP and can login to ZP directly to manage orders. They do not see user details, pricing, payments or any other info held within M.
Normally, orders would be managed through M. Faulty orders may need functions available only wihin ZP.

== User order management ==
Users registered via M cannot login to ZP and cannot access their order history there.
They use M for that.

== Personalization form ==
