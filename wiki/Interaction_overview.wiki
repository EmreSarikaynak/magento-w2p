= Products =

== Static products ==
Magento and ZetaPrints have their own product databases. 
The store can have products created directly in M without a corresponding product in ZP. Such products have no personalization capabilities.

== Dynamic products ==
This extension downloads list of template details from Zetaprints into M. This extension maintains M. database in sync with ZetaPrints database by downloading updated records.

Products in ZP have special properties and initial preview images (thumbnails and large previews). They can be downloaded into M or served directly from ZP.

= Users =
ZetaPrints does not require full user registration to use the services. It only needs a user ID for data caching and resource allocation. The extension creates corresponding user in ZetaPrints (with generated user ID and password) for every user in M. who uses web-to-print features. See http://www.zetaprints.com/help/user-registration-api

See also page about UserManagement.

== User access control ==
This extension instructs ZP to grant/deny users access to certain catalogs via API (http://www.zetaprints.com/help/user-access-api/)

= Orders =
Order information is synced between ZetaPrints and M. through this extension.
Zetaprints is only concerned with the image and file generation part of the order. It produces the final product M. sells to the user.

== Shop owner order management ==
Shop owners have printer accounts with ZP and can login to ZP directly to manage orders. They do not see user details, pricing, payments or any other info held within M.
Normally, orders would be managed through M. Faulty orders may need functions available only wihin ZP.

== User order management ==
Users registered via M cannot login to ZP and cannot access their order history there.
They use M for that.
