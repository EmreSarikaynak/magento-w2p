== Using custom options for the first time ==

If you're using custom options for the first time, you have to create a config file.

  # Open your preferred text editor
  # Put following content into it
  # Save as custom-options.xml
  # Upload the file to app/code/local/ZetaPrints/WebToPrint/etc directory on your M. installation.

Content of custom-options.xml file:
{{{
<config>
  <webtoprint>
    <file-download>
      <users allow="1" />
    </file-download>
  </webtoprint>
</config>
}}}

== Adding option to an existing config file ==

You just have to add option to your config file.

  # Open custom-options.xml file in your editor (you may need to download the file from your M. installation)
  # If `<file-download>` tag exist in the file then just add `<users allow="1" />`, otherwise add `<file-download>` and `<users allow="1" />` tags into `<webtoprint>` one.
  # Save and upload config file.

After editing the content between `<webtoprint>` and `</webtoprint>` tags in your config file should be similar to:
{{{
<file-download>
  <users allow="1" />
</file-download>
}}}
