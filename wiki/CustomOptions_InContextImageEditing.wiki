== Using custom options first time ==

You have to create config file if you use custom options first time.

  # Open your preferred text editor
  # Put following content into it
  # Save save as custom-options.xml
  # Upload the file to app/code/local/ZetaPrints/WebToPrint/etc directory on your M. installation.

Content of custom-options.xml file:
{{{
<config>
  <webtoprint>
    <image-edit>
      <in-context enabled="yes" />
    </image-edit>
  </webtoprint>
</config>
}}}

== Adding option to existing config file ==

You just have to add option to your config file.

  # Open custom-options.xml file in your editor (you may need to download the file from your M. installation)
  # If `<image-edit>` tag exist in the file then just add `<in-context enabled="yes" />`, otherwise add `<image-edit>` and `<in-context enabled="yes" />` tags into `<webtoprint>` one.
  # Save and upload config file.

After editing the content between `<webtoprint>` and `</webtoprint>` tags in your config file should be similar to:
{{{
<image-edit>
  <in-context enabled="yes" />
</image-edit>
}}}
